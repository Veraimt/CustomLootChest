# CustomLootChest
Minecraft Plugin to easily generate Chests with custom Loot

This is my first plugin and my first use of GitHub, so don't be surprised if the code is weird. :D

I want to learn from this, so it would be nice if you leave some feedback!

## bStats
This plugin uses bStats which collects metrics about the server its running on.

To opt out, edit the `/plugins/bstats/config.yml` in your server folder.
